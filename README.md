# Flashcard-
Free flash card desktop application.  

The end goal for this project is to create a desktop application that can be played localy without internet. Quizlet has been the go to app for flashcards for far too long. Their prices are ridiculous and the free version lacks many of the features that made the app an effective learning tool to begin with. Eventually I would like to launch a mobile app but we will cross that bridge when we have a functioning desktop app first.
